# level 1 web crawler.

This is a very basic webcrawler using selenium webdrivers. selenium is super
powerful and amazing for web page interaction when crawling, which may not be
important in some cases.

I also want to point out. I have another project under masked chrome client 
and in this code I implement user agents "android clients" to mask my identity
aswell diactivate my test software flags making the client seam more like a 
normal user. also if you crawl any page to fask your probably going to get
booted!

( I'm testing this out on my own webpage, and if you dont have look for sites
like books.toscrape.com)
